# Stock Information Project
## Python, Flask, HTML, CSS

************************************************************

The purpose of this project was to provide users a space to consume vital information about a group of public companies' stocks. Ultimately the final iteration of the Flask web application included a form for the user to input some number of asset tickers, whether they represent individual publicly-traded companies, crypto symbols, ETFs, larger indexes, etc. A correlation matrix is displayed with regard to each asset's returns over some period of time (that the user also chooses on the web app). Superfluous information such as full company name, current asset price, beta, market cap, and trailing and forward price-to-earnings ratios are also displayed in a tabular format. 

If applicable, any chosen public company will also have their upcoming earnings date included as well. Further down the page houses historical price information of each asset, including asset price, simple and exponential moving averages, and Bollinger Bands. These are plotly graphics allowing the user to curate the graph to whatever display he/she would like before having the capacity to download the plot. 

***********************************************************

This project utilized Python, specifically the Yahoo Finance and Plotly Express packages. Flask is the framework, with structure and styling constructed with HTML and CSS. 

Down the line, the plan is try out Vercel for the first time to host this project, and have my noahcread.com website to include a link to the web app.

Thanks for reading, and enjoy. Please feel free to reach out with thoughts or improvements.
